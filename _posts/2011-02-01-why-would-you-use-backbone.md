# Why do you need Backbone.js?

Building single-page web apps or complicated user interfaces will get extremely difficult by simply using [jQuery](http://jquery.com) or [MooTools](http://mootools.net).   The problem is standard JavaScript libraries are great at what they do - and without realizing it you can build an entire application without any formal structure.   You will with ease turn your application into a nested pile of jQuery callbacks, all tied to concrete DOM elements.

I shouldn't need to explain why building something without any structure is a bad idea.   Of course you can always invent your own way of structuring your application but you miss out on the benefits of the open source community.



## So how does Backbone.js help?

Backbone is an incredibly small library for the amount of functionality and structure it gives you.   It is essentially MVC for the client and allows you to make your code modular.   If you read through some of the beginner tutorials the benefits will soon become self evident and due to Backbone.js light nature you can incrementally include it in any current or future projects.
